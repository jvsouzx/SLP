# Single Layer Perceptron (SLP)
Implementation of a Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) in Python for IC discipline.

A Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) is the simplest form of a neural network. 
It consists of only one layer of artificial neurons, often called perceptrons, which take inputs, apply weights to them, and produce an output. 
SLPs are typically used for binary classification tasks, where they can learn to classify inputs into two categories based on the input features.
